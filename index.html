        Happy 3 months babyyy. The fact that its's already been 3 months and we went through so many things together, either being lovey moments or getting caught 😔, life just felt like a roller coaster with you, baby. I still remember that day when we first met. It was a dreamy feeling to finally have a girl I love in my arms in front of me. No matter how many fights we have been through, we always sort them out. Baby, I want to stay w you forever so pls breakup ka mat sochio kbhi 😔. I love you soooooooooooo fucking much. I miss you THE WHOLE DAY. Rarely a minute passes in which ion think about you atleast for a second. I smell your hair tie like 15 times a day. I hope you miss me the same way 🤩. Whenever we meet I might get a little shy because you are eventually my first proper relationship. But baby i love meeting you every time and i never geg bored of it. I love sitting with you so so so much. Lying on your shoulder while you play with my hair is the best feeling i could get ever. Baby you make me smile everyday. I get so worried if youre just 30 minutes late to answer my texts 😔. I just don’t want my baby in any problem. I am unable to even sleep when you’re sick or stuck in any issue. Baby, i want anniversaries like these to come and go forever. Either its our one year or our ten years i wont leave you ever. I am learning from some mistakes i would have made in our early months, so i dont repeat them again and always keep you happy as a good boyfie you will love forever. You are my prettiest girl. I love to kiss you sososososo much 😍. My baby is so beautiful your face definitely needs my kisses 😘. At the end baby i love you a lot and i want a proper future with you. Small fights should never be the reason of us parting ways, and we should fight every obstacle against us.
